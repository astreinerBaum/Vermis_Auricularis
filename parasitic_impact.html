        For a <a href="#" onclick="longtime()">long time</a>, it was not known whether <i>vermis auricularis</i> in any way feeds off its hosts, or uses it as habitat only. Recent scientific discoveries demonstrate his infiltration during a so-called
        "low attention state". Once intruded during this state, <i>vermis auricularis</i> helps to maintain this status. The parasite feeds on productive thoughts, on the concentration of its host. Here we find a symbiotic system, which is discussed in
        more detail below. </p>
