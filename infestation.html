        The actual infestation by vermis auricularis is often inconspicuous and can take place at any time of the day or in any climatic zone. Sometimes he is noticed by the occupied host only a few minutes, or even a few hours later. The implantation takes place through the auditory canal of the affected person. After the complete immobilization in the brain of the host, which may take place in a fraction of a second, or a few hours, depending on the nature of the parasitic specimen, the unfolding of its action becomes noticeable.
