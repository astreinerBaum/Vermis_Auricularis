        One of the earliest, at least written, encounters with <i>vermis auricularis</i> goes back to Mark Twain. Already in 1876 he held his own infestation, without naming the species, but having brought to paper a detailed recollection of his <a href="#"
          onclick="encounter()">encounter</a>. According to his lively description all actions such as reading, sleeping, conversation or forming simple thoughts were rendered impossible: <br> “I fought hard for an hour, but it was useless. My head kept humming,
        <a href="#" onclick="ellipsis()">[...]</a> and so on and so on, without peace or respite. The day's work was ruined.” He finally could expel the parasite, only through passing it on to a dear friend. After also being tormented for days, locked
        in limbo of the forced "low attention state", his friend and follow up host sought <a href="#" onclick="help()">help</a> from Mark Twain, who came up with a solution: “How did I finally save him from an asylum? I took him to a neighboring university
        and made him <a href="#" onclick="discharge()">discharge</a> the burden of his persecuting rhymes into the eager ears of the poor, unthinking students.”
