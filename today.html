        What in Twain's descriptions reads as a plague that can be solved as quickly as possible, we now regard as salvation! <br> 140 years after the first encounter, we live in a present where work has not become less by technical progress, but where
        it is precisely technology that makes the work so omnipresent. <br> The eroding of the boundaries between work and leisure, the internalized <a href="#" onclick="neolib()">neoliberal paradigms</a> of constant availability, endless progress,
        lifelong learning, and unbridled creativity, we now recognize - are not infinite jest, but never-ending <a href="#" onclick="work()">work</a>. Where the knowledge of this dictum of work is lacking, or the fear of being left behind in order
        not to lose a market advantage too great, or where one's own strength is insufficient to break the social conditioning, there lies the parasitic potential of <i>vermis auricularis</i>. It has the ability to find hosts where needed the most - where
        people can not find an end to their labor, where the thoughts of productivity reach into their sleep. There, the <i>vermis auricularis</i> can eat itself fat.</p>
