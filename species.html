      <p>
        The genus <i>vermis auricularis</i> is a parasitic being, which seeks <a href="#" onclick="humans()">humans</a> as it's host. There are countless species of this genus that differ locally and temporally. Vermis auricularis is a temporary facultative parasite, meaning it is an occasional parasite, and therefore does not depend on a host to <a href="#" onclick="survive()">survive</a>; it usually serves as a means of transport. Generally only one specimen of the species can occupy a host, but at times various specimens can perform a rapid flying splice. Some specimens are highly host-specific, others less selective in the choice of their hosts. Also the retention time of a specimen is extremely variable. Known cases range from the short-term one-time infestation, to the periodic recurrence over the whole <a href="#" onclick="life()">life</a> of the respective host.
