        The genus vermis auricularis is a parasitic being, which peoples <a href="#" onclick="humans()">humans</a> as host. There are countless species of this genus that differ locally and temporally. vermis auricularis is a temporary facultative parasite, that is, an occasional parasite, and therefore does not need a host to <a href="#" onclick="survive()">survive</a>; it usually serves as a means of transport. I.d.R. only one specimen of the species can occupy a host, but at times various specimens can perform a rapid, flying change. Some specimens are highly host-specific, others less selective in the choice of their hosts. Also the length of time of a specimen is extremely variable. Known cases range from the short-term one-time infestation, to the periodic recurrence over the whole <a href="#" onclick="life()">life</a> of the respective host. (Endo and exo parasite).
