        Now the readers would be right to argue that the so called attention economy with its apps, and a surge of social media and other news-feeds constantly call for our attention. With the aim of distracting us from concentrated work, complex thoughts, and
        deeper <a href="#" onclick="interaction()">interaction</a> with our fellow human beings. This assumption is correct. But these processes represent no contradiction to the dictum of labor, but rather an extension, even a reproduction of it.
        As we are not the customers but the products, all time and attention we spend is not leisure but essentially also work.
