        Part of its mechanisms is to be perceived only fragmentary. Incomplete perception has a special effect: If something can not be thought through to the <a href="#" onclick="theEnd()">end</a>, the thought starts from the beginning. The victims are in the endless
        loop. This inner "stepping on the spot", the "broken record effect", penetrates the outside - so that no more work can be completed and the productivity remains on the line. Not only the narrow repetition cycles of the <i>vermis auricularis</i> are consuming
        brain capacity, but also the thoughts which it causes in the host are part of its mechanisms of action: Where did I get infected? What is the nature of the species and what form does it have? There are many, supposedly, scientifically proven methods
        for the expulsion of vermis auricularis. However, at this point it is anticipated that none of these remedies work in any reliable manner. History teaches us there is only one specific way to discharge the parasite. </p>
